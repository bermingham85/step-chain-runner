Build a webhook-driven receipt ingestion and validation pipeline.

The system should:
- Receive WellyBox webhook payloads (JSON) via HTTP endpoint
- Handle both single receipts and batch receipts in one webhook
- Dynamically discover all fields in the webhook (don't assume fixed schema)
- Create or open a Google Sheet in a specific Drive folder
- Write header row on first use, then append each receipt as a new row
- If new fields appear in later webhooks, expand the header automatically
- Always store the full raw webhook JSON in a column called raw_payload_json

Metadata columns to add:
- received_at_utc (ISO timestamp)
- source (always "wellybox")
- receipt_id (extract from webhook or generate from hash)
- receipt_hash (SHA256 of raw receipt JSON)
- processing_status (set to "RECEIVED" initially)

OCR comparison:
- Accept a second OCR output (OCR2) for the same receipt
- Normalize both WellyBox and OCR2 into a canonical schema:
  supplier_name, invoice_number, invoice_date, currency, total, vat, subtotal, payment_method, line_items_count
- Compare the two sources field by field
- If differences exceed tolerance (total off by more than 0.02, date mismatch, supplier mismatch, missing invoice_number):
  set processing_status = HOLD_REVIEW
  store a diff_summary JSON
- If matching within tolerance:
  set processing_status = READY_FOR_REVIEW

Human review:
- Add columns: reviewer_decision, reviewer_notes, reviewer_corrected_fields_json, reviewed_at_utc
- Reviewers can update rows (PASS/FAIL/EDITED) without breaking future appends

Deliverables:
- Complete runnable Python FastAPI webhook server
- Google Sheets integration using service account
- Dynamic field discovery and header expansion logic
- OCR comparison with tolerance rules
- Test payload examples
- curl commands for testing
- Setup instructions for Google Cloud service account

Constraints:
- Must be copy/paste runnable
- Must not require paid services beyond Google APIs
- Must never lose data (raw_payload_json always written even on errors)
- Minimal dependencies
- Clear function boundaries for later n8n integration
